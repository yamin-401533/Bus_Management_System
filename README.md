Project Overview: WE Bus Management System


Project Description: 
The Bus Management System is a desktop application built using Qt C++ framework. It aims to provide a comprehensive solution for managing bus operations, including scheduling, passenger booking, and route planning. The system will cater to the needs of bus operators, enabling them to streamline their business processes and improve overall efficiency.


Key Features:
Bus Schedule Management: The system will allow users to create, view, and modify bus schedules, including departure and arrival times, routes, and bus capacities.
Passenger Booking: Passengers will be able to search for available bus trips, book tickets, and manage their reservations. The system will handle seat allocation and provide real-time updates on seat availability.
Route Planning: The system will provide tools for planning and optimizing bus routes, taking into account factors such as passenger demand, traffic patterns, and operational constraints.
Reporting and Analytics: The system will generate various reports and analytics to help bus operators make informed decisions, such as passenger volume, revenue, and operational efficiency.
User Management: The system will have different user roles (e.g., bus operators, administrators) with corresponding access privileges and permissions.
